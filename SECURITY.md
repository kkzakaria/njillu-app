- [x] Security headers implemented (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [x] Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [x] Secret rotation capabilities
- [x] Network security and firewall rules

### üìä Monitoring & Logging

- [x] Error tracking with Sentry (production)
- [x] Health check endpoints with rate limiting
- [x] Audit trails for sensitive operations
- [x] Performance monitoring and alerting

### üîê Data Protection
- [x] Data encryption at rest and in transit
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- [x] XSS protection with Content Security Policy
- [x] CSRF protection with SameSite cookies

### üöÄ Deployment Security
- [x] Secure CI/CD pipeline with dependency scanning
- [x] Production build optimization and minification
- [x] Source map security (hidden in production)
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] Container security scanning

## Security Headers Configuration

The following security headers are automatically applied:

```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
Content-Security-Policy: [Configured for production]
```

## Environment Security

### Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Required security configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-min-32-chars
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-cron-secret
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id

# Supabase configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### Security Best Practices
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Rotate keys regularly** (minimum quarterly)
3. **Use environment-specific secrets** for dev/staging/prod
4. **Monitor for leaked credentials** in logs and code
5. **Implement least-privilege access** for all services

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency updates with security patch priority
- Trivy security scanner for comprehensive vulnerability assessment

### Security Testing
- Automated security tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular penetration testing (recommended quarterly)
- Code security reviews for sensitive changes

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Identify and contain the security incident
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Preserve evidence and logs

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and monitoring data
   - Identify root cause and attack vectors
   - Document findings and timeline

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes and security improvements
   - Rotate affected credentials and secrets
   - Monitor for continued threats

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement additional monitoring/controls

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

1. **Email**: security@your-domain.com
2. **Provide details**: Include steps to reproduce and potential impact
3. **Response time**: We aim to acknowledge within 24 hours
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate responsible disclosure timeline

### Bug Bounty (Optional)
Consider implementing a bug bounty program for:
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Data exposure issues
- Infrastructure security flaws

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR/Privacy
- User data minimization and purpose limitation
- Right to erasure implementation
- Data portability features
- Privacy-by-design architecture

### Industry Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment
- ISO 27001 security management principles
- SOC 2 Type II readiness

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth
```
User Request
    ‚Üì
CDN/WAF (Cloudflare/AWS WAF)
    ‚Üì
Load Balancer (SSL Termination)
    ‚Üì
Application Security (Next.js Middleware)
    ‚Üì
Authentication (Supabase Auth + JWT)
    ‚Üì
Authorization (RLS Policies)
    ‚Üì
Database (PostgreSQL with RLS)
```

### Zero Trust Model
- Verify every request explicitly
- Use least-privilege access principles
- Assume breach and minimize impact
- Monitor and validate continuously
